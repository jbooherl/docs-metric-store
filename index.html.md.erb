## <a id='about'></a> About Metric Store

Metric Store provides a persistent storage layer for metrics sent through the Loggregator subsystem. It is multi-tenant aware (the auth proxy ensures that you only have access to metrics from your apps), easy to query (it is compatible with the [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)), and has a powerful storage engine (the [InfluxDB storage engine](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb) has built-in compression and a memory-efficient series index).

- **Multi-tenant aware:** Application Developers have access to their own metrics.
- **Ubiquitous Query Language:** Metric Store is compatible with PromQL and Prometheus API Query endpoints.
- **Powerful Storage Engine:** The InfluxDB storage engine has built-in compression and a memory-efficient series index.

Metric Store offers multi-node deployments, data replication, hinted handoff, and load balancing in a highly-available configuration.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The only officially supported use case for the Metric Store product is as the backing Time Series Database for <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/app-metrics/2-0/">App Metrics v2.0</a> and <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/2-9/console/index.html">TAS v2.9+ Apps Manager</a>. Use cases outside of these bounds have no guarantee of continued support or availability.</p>

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

Metric Store has the following limitations:

- Horizontally scaling Metric Store currently results in data loss. Vertical scaling is recommended at this time.
- Platforms are ever changing and we cannot guarantee metric stability. Using Metric Store through products like [App Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/app-metrics/2-0/) or [Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/2-8/console/index.html) will be supported use cases. Using the Metric Store manually through endpoints, the user will need to be aware of changes through Platform upgrades.
